# Qlik Sense Field Action Triggers

## Description

This Qlik Sense extension lets you tie actions

## Installation

Download the zip from here: 

Unzip the file to the directory C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions

Drag the extension 'Field Action Trigger' onto the sheet.  The extension will not show on the page but needs to be included on a sheet to work properly.  Configure your triggers via the properties panel.

There is a sample QVF included here that should serve as a good introduction to how the extension can be used.
