# Qlik Sense Field Action Triggers

## Description

This Qlik Sense extension lets you tie actions to field selections.  Drop this extension on the corner of a sheet and configure it to create one or many actions that are fired when a field is selected.  This project was inspired by the 'Triggers' functionality available in QlikView.

## Installation

Download the zip from here the [latest release](https://github.com/mcgovey/qlik-sense-action-triggers/releases/latest)

Unzip the file to the directory C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions

Drag the extension 'Field Action Trigger' onto the sheet.  The extension will not show on the page but needs to be included on a sheet to work properly.  Configure your triggers via the properties panel.

There is a sample QVF included [here](https://github.com/mcgovey/qlik-sense-action-triggers/tree/master/doc) that should serve as a good introduction to how the extension can be used.
